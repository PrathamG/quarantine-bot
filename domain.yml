        Mindfulness meditation is an effective technique to reduce stress, improve focus, and reach a mentally clear and enotionally stable state. Here are some basic instructions to help you get started --
          1. Take a seat in a calm and quiet environment. üòå
          2. Set a time limit. If this is your first time, you can start with a shorter time limit such as 5 or 10 minutes. ‚åö
          3. Feel your breath. Feel your body physically inhale and exhale. üå¨Ô∏è
          4. Your mind will inevitably lose attention from your breath. When you notice your mind wandering, do not feel guilty or obsess about what you were thinking. Simply return your attention to your breathing.
          5. When you are ready to stop, gently lift your eyes. Take a moment to notice your environment, thoughts, emotions and physical sensations
